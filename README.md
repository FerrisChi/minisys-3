# minisys-3
 A basic MIPS CPU built in 3 days.

Due to time restraints, a single-cycle MIPS CPU with 31 instructions was built. Also, we tried multi-cycle MIPS CPU and haven't take it into fully implementation. 

Thanks to the SEU course, we abandoned our thought of building with RISC-V instruction set. But it turned out that they've made more features than us,  including interrupt, CPU pipeline and so on.

`orgnization` contains a assembler made by SEU professors.

`softwares` contains assemble software written by our mates and only made for MIPS.

`ref` contains a reference project.
